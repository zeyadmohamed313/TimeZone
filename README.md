Constructed on a robust 3-tier architecture, my ASP.NET Core MVC project optimizes data handling through tools like AutoMapper and the Specification Pattern. Identity ensures secure user authentication, while SOLID principles shape the codebase. Caching mechanisms elevate performance, fostering scalability.

With a foundation in Dependency Injection, the project seamlessly integrates External Login via Google and Microsoft, enhancing the user experience. It introduces a secure password reset system via email and streamlines Stripe integration for payments. The frontend, powered by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, crafts a dynamic and engaging user interface, harmonizing within the well-organized 3-tier structure.
